## Getting the game
Right now the simplest way to get snake is to build it from source using Cargo. Just clone this repo and run `cargo build --release`. The compiled binary will be in `target/release/snake`.

## Running the game
Once you have built snake, just run the snake binary to start the game. Use the arrow keys to move.
